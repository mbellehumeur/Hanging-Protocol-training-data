 # SIIM Hackathon 2025  -  Standardized, personal training data for GenAI hanging protocols
 We want to  propose a standardized way of storing personal hanging protocol AI training data.  
 This data would be used by PACS viewers to infer the appropriate display of the images available.  
 Radiologists would no longer have to train/configure each viewer they encounter.  
 They would instead provide access to their personal training data repository to the viewer software. 
 Ideally, the viewers would not only use the data for display but also provide the ability to add new hanging protocol training cases to the repository. 
 
 The project would produce  an open source proof of concept  to store hanging protocol training data to a Github repository.  
 SIIM conference users could create their own personal repository  and start generating their training data using the SIIM studies and the OHIF viewer by hanging a case according to their preferences and then clicking on a "save this display layout to my AI training repository" button.
